# Rakamin Muamalat Sales Dashboard

I completed my final project for the Rakamin virtual internship in collaboration with Bank Muamalat. 

In this project, I integrated all the tables from the dataset in Excel to create a master table in BigQuery. 

Subsequently, I developed a dashboard using Google Looker Studio.

Upon analyzing the data, I uncovered the following insights:

* Robot products achieved the highest total sales for the company.
* Ebook products recorded the highest total orders for the company.
* The city of Washington contributed the most to both total sales and total orders.
